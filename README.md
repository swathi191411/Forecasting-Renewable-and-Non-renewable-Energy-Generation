# Forecasting-Renewable-and-Non-renewable-Energy-Generation
Energy Generation and Demand Patterns using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques
# The title of your project, "Forecasting and Analyzing Renewable and Non-renewable Energy Generation and Demand Patterns using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques", can be broken down into several key components, each describing an important aspect of your research focus:
1. # Forecasting:
•	Definition: Forecasting refers to the process of predicting future values based on historical data.
•	Relevance: In the context of energy, forecasting helps predict future energy generation and demand, which is critical for energy planning, grid management, and policy-making.
•	Energy is the capacity to do work, and it exists in various forms such as kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, electrical, and more. It plays a crucial role in everyday life, powering everything from machinery to human activity.1 kWh is the amount of energy consumed by a 1,000-watt appliance running for one hour.
•	Purpose in the Project: The project aims to develop models that can accurately predict future energy generation from both renewable and non-renewable sources, as well as energy demand patterns.
2. # Analyzing:
•	Definition: Analyzing refers to the detailed examination of data to understand patterns, trends, and insights.
•	Relevance: Analyzing energy generation and demand patterns is crucial for understanding the efficiency and sustainability of energy sources, identifying trends, and making informed decisions.
•	Purpose in the Project: The project will involve deep analysis of energy data, identifying key factors influencing energy production and consumption, seasonal trends, and anomalies.
3. # Renewable and Non-renewable Energy Generation:
•	Renewable Energy: Refers to energy sources that are naturally replenished, such as solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. These sources are considered sustainable and environmentally friendly.
•	Non-renewable Energy: Refers to energy derived from finite resources like fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), which cannot be replenished and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
•	Purpose in the Project: The project will study both renewable and non-renewable energy sources, examining their generation capacities, usage trends, and potential for future development. This includes comparing their patterns of generation and impact on energy markets.
4. Energy Demand Patterns:
•	Definition: Energy demand refers to the amount of energy consumed by consumers, industries, and institutions at any given time.
•	Relevance: Understanding demand patterns is crucial for efficient energy management and balancing supply and demand to avoid shortages or wastage.
•	Purpose in the Project: The project will focus on analyzing how energy demand fluctuates over time, affected by factors like time of day, season, economic activity, and weather. It will explore correlations between generation patterns and demand, helping optimize the energy supply chain.
5. Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques:
•	Machine Learning (ML): Refers to algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Common ML techniques include regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
•	Deep Learning (DL): A subset of machine learning, deep learning involves artificial neural networks with multiple layers that can model complex patterns in large datasets. DL is especially useful in handling time series data and making highly accurate forecasts.
•	Relevance: ML and DL techniques are increasingly being used to forecast energy demand and generation due to their ability to handle large, complex datasets and uncover patterns that are not immediately apparent.
•	Purpose in the Project: The project aims to apply both machine learning and deep learning methods to improve the accuracy of energy forecasting models. These techniques will help analyze the complex relationships between different energy sources, demand patterns, and external influencing factors like weather.
Problem Statement:
Accurate forecasting of energy generation and demand is a critical challenge due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, and the fluctuating patterns of energy demand. Traditional forecasting models struggle with the complexity of modern energy systems, leading to inefficiencies and grid instability. This project aims to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve the prediction of renewable and non-renewable energy generation and demand, enhancing energy management and sustainability.
Dataset Description:
The dataset is related to energy generation, consumption, load forecasting, and pricing data. 
1.	time: The timestamp of the recorded data, including the date and time. It also contains timezone information (+01:00), which suggests that the dataset might be from a European country.
2.	generation biomass: The amount of energy generated from biomass (organic material used as fuel), measured in megawatts (MW) or similar energy units.
3.	generation fossil brown coal/lignite: Energy generated from burning brown coal or lignite, a type of fossil fuel that's less efficient and more polluting compared to hard coal.
4.	generation fossil coal-derived gas: The amount of energy generated from gases produced by gasifying or otherwise processing coal.
5.	generation fossil gas: Energy produced from burning natural gas, a fossil fuel that emits lower CO2 compared to coal or oil but still contributes to greenhouse gases.
6.	generation fossil hard coal: Energy generated from burning hard coal (anthracite), which is a denser and more efficient form of coal compared to lignite.
7.	generation fossil oil: The amount of energy produced from burning crude oil or its derivatives.
8.	generation fossil oil shale: Energy produced from oil shale, a sedimentary rock that contains organic material which can be converted to shale oil.
9.	generation fossil peat: Energy generated from peat, an accumulation of decayed organic matter used as a fossil fuel. It's often considered an early stage of coal formation.
10.	generation geothermal: The amount of energy generated using heat from the Earth’s core.
11.	generation hydro pumped storage aggregated: Total energy generated through hydroelectric pumped storage, where water is pumped to a higher elevation during low demand and released to generate electricity during peak demand.
12.	generation hydro pumped storage consumption: The amount of energy consumed in pumping water uphill in hydroelectric pumped storage systems. This is typically a negative value, as it represents energy used rather than produced.
13.	generation hydro run-of-river and poundage: Energy generated by hydroelectric plants using the natural flow of a river (run-of-river) without large reservoirs. It can also include small water storage for balancing purposes (poundage).
14.	generation hydro water reservoir: The amount of energy generated using water stored in large reservoirs, typically in a dam-based hydroelectric power plant.

27.	total load actual: The actual measured total energy demand or load on the grid at that specific time.
28.	price day ahead: The predicted or set energy price for the next day in the energy market, often determined in day-ahead markets.
29.	price actual: The actual price of electricity in the energy market at that specific time, reflecting real-time supply and demand dynamics.
Each of these features provides valuable information regarding energy generation, consumption, forecasting, and market prices, which can be used for analyzing energy production trends, supply and demand balance, and price fluctuations.
In our dataset, the target feature is typically the one we are trying to predict or analyze based on other features. From the features listed, the most likely candidates for the target feature are related to prices or loads, as these are common outcomes in energy and forecasting datasets.
Given the features provided:
•	price day ahead
•	price actual
These features represent the energy price, which is often a primary target in energy datasets for forecasting models. Similarly:
•	total load forecast
•	total load actual
These features relate to energy load forecasting, which could also be a target depending on your use case.
Time example:
The value 2015-01-01 00:00:00+01:00 is a timestamp with timezone information. 
•	2015-01-01: The date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, meaning January 1st, 2015.
•	00:00:00: The time in the format HH:MM:SS, representing midnight (12:00 AM).
•	+01:00: This indicates the timezone offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The +01:00 means that the time is 1 hour ahead of UTC. This could correspond to Central European Time (CET) or another timezone that is UTC+1.
Thus, 2015-01-01 00:00:00+01:00 means "midnight on January 1st, 2015, in a timezone that is 1 hour ahead of UTC."
